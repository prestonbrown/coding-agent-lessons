## Active Lessons


### [L001] [*----|-----] Delimiter conflicts
- **Uses**: 1 | **Velocity**: 0 | **Learned**: 2025-12-27 | **Last**: 2025-12-27 | **Category**: pattern
> When adding special characters to display formats (like | in star ratings), check if they conflict with internal delimiters used for parsing. We had to switch from | to ~ as the internal field separator.


### [L002] [*----|+----] Two-phase file updates
- **Uses**: 2 | **Velocity**: 1 | **Learned**: 2025-12-27 | **Last**: 2025-12-27 | **Category**: pattern
> When modifying a file based on its contents, collect items to change first, then apply updates with fresh reads. Modifying while reading causes stale data bugs.


### [L003] [*----|+----] Test HOME override
- **Uses**: 2 | **Velocity**: 1 | **Learned**: 2025-12-27 | **Last**: 2025-12-27 | **Category**: gotcha
> When tests override HOME, hooks still look for manager at hardcoded paths. Must symlink manager to test LESSONS_BASE or tests fail silently.
